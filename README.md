## Trello Like Board Project

The project is a combination of two parts:

1.  The [link](https://phppot.com/php/trello-like-drag-and-drop-cards-for-project-management-software/) contains all the backend and frontend files to create a single board with MySQL database and jQuery 
You can have a look at the [Demo](https://phppot.com/demo/trello-like-drag-and-drop-cards-for-project-management-software/)

2. The power of Drag and Drop from [Sortable](https://sortablejs.github.io/Sortable/). Download sortable.js file to make all the magic! [link](https://github.com/SortableJS/Sortable)
